# AI-generated-art
This repo consists of two techniques i.e Deep Dream and Neural Style Transfer which are widely used to generate artistic content using AI
- What if we ran a pre-trained CNN in reverse?
- Before Google’s DeepDream was announced, very few, even in the AI world, thought AI (in the near future) would be able to produce art and content indistinguishable from human creations.
- Google’s DeepDream was the first to really show, AI can generate exciting and enjoyable content.

## Deep Dream
- Deep Dream is an artistic image-modification technique that uses representations learned by CNNs to produce hallucinogenic or ‘trippy’ images. It was introduced by C. Olah A. Mordvintsev and M. Tyka of Google Research in 2015 in publication titled “DeepDream: A Code Example for Visualizing Neural Networks”

## Neural Style Transfer
- Introduced by Leon Gatys et al. in 2015, in their paper titled “A Neural Algorithm for Artistic Style”, the Neural Style Transfer algorithm went viral resulting in an explosion of further work and mobile apps.
- Neural Style Transfer enables the artistic style of an image to be applied to another image! It copies the color patterns, combinations and brush strokes of the original source image and applies it to your input image.
- And I think it is one the most impressive implementations of Neural Networks.
